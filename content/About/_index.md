Howdy! I am in the second year of my master's at Texas A&M, studying mathematics. My advisor is Frank Sottile. I graduated from Texas A&M in December of 2022 with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Mathematics (Honors) with a Biological Science concentration. As an undergraduate, I was a Regent's Scholar (awarded to first-generation students), and spent several years as a Biomedical Science major before finding my passion for mathematics in my senior year. I am currently applying for PhD programs in mathematics, where I hope to build upon my background and explore applications of mathematics to biology and physics.
